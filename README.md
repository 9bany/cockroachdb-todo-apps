Code newbies and new open source contributors -- help us build our repository of CockroachDB To-Do apps! 

## The Challenge

Build a To-Do app using CockroachDB and a language/ORM of your choice!

## What is CockroachDB?
CockroachDB is the distributed SQL database built to scale fast, survive anything, and thrive everywhere. Whether you are a single-person startup or a global enterprise, CockroachDB was designed to make managing data easy. To learn more about CockroachDB, see our [website](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) and [docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/).
