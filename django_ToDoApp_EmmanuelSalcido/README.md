## TODO app with Django example using CockroackDB :snake: 

Hi, here is a simple Backend service where you can get, create, update and delete items (simple CRUD operetions).

I use Docker to start DB cluster and followed the below documentation. 
DB only have one table with the items created by user

I want to learn more about cockroach and django so I want to continue contributing on this.
